# Who am I?
Hey, I'm Dane. Currently working as a frontend developer at BMO on the platform team.

## Current interests
My interests include learning about accessibility, cloud technologies, golang, rust and building useless side projects.

## Fun stuff
In my spare time I enjoy watching Formula 1, watching basketball, binging netflix series, skateboarding, bike riding, eating food (feel free to send me food recs) and finding new music to listen to.
