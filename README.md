# Who am I?
I'm a developer from Toronto interested in making cool and accessible websites for everyone.

I got my start in programming through video games and just being very curious about how things worked. Eventually that turned in to developing websites which I am still doing today but I have interests in other areas such as DevOps and Game Development. I also try to blog about things I've learned when I remember to do so.

## Current interests
My current interests are DevOps, Game Development, learning Go and reading tech related books! I'm also working on a few ideas for 2024, keep an eye out for projects that I might ship!

## Fun stuff
In my spare time I enjoy watching Formula 1, basketball, listening to music, playing video games, working out and trying out new food!
