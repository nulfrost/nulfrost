# Who am I?
Hey, I'm Dane. Currently working as a frontend developer at BMO on the accessibility team.

## Current interests
My interests tend to change from week to week but right now I'm currently focused on learning more about accessibility, learning golang, and reading a lot about system design / cloud technologies.

## Fun stuff
In my spare time I enjoy watching Formula 1 (big HAAS fan), binging netflix series, skateboarding, bike riding, eating food (feel free to send me food recs) and finding new music to listen to.
